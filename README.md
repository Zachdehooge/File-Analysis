# Malware-Analysis-Tool
- A malware analysis tool that takes in a file from the user and checks the SHA-256 with Virustotal and returns the result
- Down the road the plan is to also allow for the upload/query of the file through MalwareBazaar and return back results such as the yara rule, origin country, signature, and more!
